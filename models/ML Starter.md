# What is Machine Learning (ML)?

**Definition:**  
Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn from data and improve their performance on a task without being explicitly programmed for every single case.

In other words, instead of writing explicit instructions, we provide data and let the computer learn patterns from that data to make predictions or decisions.


# Example to Understand ML

Imagine you want a computer program to recognize if an email is spam or not spam.

- **Traditional programming:**  
  You would write rules manually, like "if email contains the word 'lottery', mark as spam," but this is hard to maintain and not very accurate.

- **Machine Learning approach:**  
  You give the program many examples of spam and non-spam emails. The program learns patterns from these examples (like certain words, sender behavior, etc.) and then can predict if a new email is spam or not.

# Simple Real-World Example:

**Predicting House Prices**

- You have a dataset with houses, each described by features like size (square feet), number of bedrooms, location, etc., along with the price it was sold for.
- Machine Learning can find the relationship between these features and the price.
- Then, given a new house's features, the ML model predicts the price.

# Introduction to Machine Learning Concepts
- What is supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning?
- Learn common algorithms:
  - Linear Regression
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - Clustering (K-Means)

# Types of Machine Learning (ML) with Examples

Machine Learning can be broadly categorized into **three main types**:

## 1. Supervised Learning

- **What it is:**  
  The model is trained on a labeled dataset, which means each training example comes with the correct answer (label). The goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs.

- **Example:**  
  Predicting house prices based on features like size and location (regression).  
  Classifying emails as spam or not spam (classification).

- **Algorithms:**  
  - Linear Regression  
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Decision Trees  
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)  
  - Neural Networks

## 2. Unsupervised Learning

- **What it is:**  
  The model is given data without labels and must find patterns or structure in the data on its own.

- **Example:**  
  Customer segmentation â€” grouping customers into different clusters based on purchasing behavior.  
  Dimensionality reduction to visualize complex data.

- **Algorithms:**  
  - K-Means Clustering  
  - Hierarchical Clustering  
  - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

## 3. Reinforcement Learning

- **What it is:**  
  The model learns by interacting with an environment, receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties, and aims to maximize the cumulative reward over time.

- **Example:**  
  Teaching a robot to walk by rewarding successful steps.  
  Training an AI to play games like chess or Go.

- **Algorithms:**  
  - Q-Learning  
  - Deep Q Networks (DQN)  
  - Policy Gradient Methods
