# what is feature Engineering 
Feature engineering is a process using domain knowledge to extract features form raw data. There Feaures can be use to improve the performence of machine learning algo.


# Feature Engineering

1. Feature Tranform
* 1.1 Missing value Imputation
* 1.2 Handle Cataorical Features
* 1.3 Outlier detection
* 1.4 Feature Scaling


2. Feature Construction
3. Feature Selection
* Keeping some columns or removing some column

4. Feature Extraction
* extracting new features form the existing feature `programatically`


# Missing value Imputation

> we can remove the missing values or fill the missing values

> There are some ways
* for `numeric data` we can remove the data contains missing values if they are less in numbers. or we can replace with mean or median values if the number if missing value is high.
* For `categorical missing data ` we can replace the missing data with most frequest data.

# Handing Categorical Data

* on-hot encoding

# outlier detection

# Feature Scaling
